	Access Modifiers
Access modifiers are the keywords which are used with classes, variables, methods, and constructors to control their access level.

There are four access modifiers in Java.

Default
When no access modifier is specified, java is treated as a default modifier. The scope of the default modifier is limited to within the package.
Public
The scope of public modifier is to access everywhere and even outside the package.
Private
The scope of private modifier is to access within the class itself.
Protected
The scope of the protected modifier is limited within the package and all subclasses.
